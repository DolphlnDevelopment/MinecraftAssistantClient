To use, open the jar by double clicking it. A `config.json` file will generate. Put your mc details there, and run it again. After loading all, it will show a message with a command (starts with /link). Run the command ingame, and you should be ready to go!

# Commands
- make time sunny
- make time rainy
- make time night
- make time storm
- make time clear
- what's the weather
- give me velocity
- give me jump
- give me regeneration
- spawn a zombie
- spawn a creeper
- spawn a pig
- spawn a cow
- spawn a horse
- give me diamonds
- give me a sword

# Troubleshotting

### Application closes fast
- The application might not be connecting to the server successfully. Make sure you setup the details correctly on `config.json`.

### It doesn't do anything
- There are some steps you can follow:
1. Make sure you ran the /link command ingame.
2. Make sure your mic is the default one on windows config (restart the app after doing changes).
3. Make sure you have installed the English Package on Windows settings (If you're using windows).
